Unfirtunatelly, my DAG isn't running.
It executes the first task (crates SQlite table) and then stops on the next task (check api).
It just shows the task is running amd the status never changes.
I attached some images with logs that indicate weird behaviour.
Maybe some problems with operating system (MacOS), but I couldn't find the root cause.
